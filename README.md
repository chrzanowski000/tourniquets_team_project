# tourniquets_team_project
In the face of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia on 24th of February 2022, an idea emerged among some students at the Faculty of Physics at the University of Warsaw. We wanted to use the resources available to us to assist the Ukrainians in any way possible. It quickly turned out that tourniquets used to stop bleeding were largely unavailable for purchase, after a surge in demand caused by the war. We also considered them relatively easy to manufacture with the resources available at Makerspace@UW, with readily available instructions online. This repository summarizes our work on the project. We first detail our work on manufacturing the tourniquets. We describe the problems we encountered and why - after a reality check - we realized that the contribution we would be able to make would be more towards testing, rather than manufacturing tourniquets. The next sections contain a literature review and our chosen testing approach based on it. Our experiment is then discussed. The conclusion suggests further steps to undertake.
